This is a fork of [OpenRails](http://www.openrails.org), running on .NET Core and based on [Monogame patch](http://www.elvastower.com/forums/index.php?/topic/30924-going-beyond-the-4-gb-of-memory/page__view__findpost__p__237281) and many other improvements and performance tweaks like completely rewritten RailDriver input, Signalscript-Parser and much more, at the same time adopting most of the updates and features from [OpenRails Source Code](https://github.com/openrails/openrails) as well.

## Feature overview
In addition to all the features from OpenRails, this version includes:  
- Most recent version of Monogame (3.8) 
- build on .NET 6, which generally allows for cross platform use (see [wiki](https://github.com/perpetualKid/ORTS-MG/wiki/Linux-Wine) for Linux support)
- full 64bit support, removing out-of-memory situations and allows to use all available system memory also beyond 3GB/4GB barrier as with 32bit software
- rewritten SignalScript parsing engine for faster loading time
- [Standalone Multiplayer server](https://github.com/perpetualKid/ORTS-MG/wiki#2021-12-05-multiplayer-standalone-server) simplifying multi-player games
- New [TrackViewer Toolbox](https://github.com/perpetualKid/ORTS-MG/wiki#2021-03-09-new-trackviewer-preview), also handling large routes smoothly
- Rewritten RailDriver support, with built-in unit calibration support, no need to to handle extra files&tools
- New Translation engine, allowing for simpler Localization (support for PoEdit .mo files removes the need for compiled resource dlls)
- Many performance optimizations
