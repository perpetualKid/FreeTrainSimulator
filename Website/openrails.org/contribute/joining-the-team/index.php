<h2>The Project Team</h2>
<p>
As <a href="../../discover/project-team/">described here</a>, there are many different and valuable roles played by the team members. Membership is not automatic but by invitation; you work with us and show us your potential and we'll issue an invitation. We enjoy a private forum to exchange ideas and discuss plans. (P.S. Thanks to Dave Nelson.)
</p>
<h2>Coding Sub-Team</h2>
<p>
A good way to get starting in coding work is to find a current bug on the <a href="../reporting-bugs/">Bug Tracker</a> (one with <span class="tt">status = Triaged</span>), assign it to yourself and start work on fixing it. This may be less exciting than adding a new feature, but it will help you become familiar with parts of the code.
</p><p>
Although we get notified automatically, it's a good idea to post a message on the <a href="http://www.elvastower.com/forums/index.php?/forum/192-discussion/">Elvas Tower forum</a> because members often respond with ideas for navigating the code, understanding the bug, fixing it or testing it. 
</p><p>
If your solution appears to fix the problem, then <a href="../developing-code/#submitting_a_change">upload a change file</a> to the forum so we can include it in the code.
