<h2>We Need Your Help</h2>
<p>
The Open Rails team, like all coding teams, cannot guarantee bullet-proof code. There are so many variables - so many routes and activities and locos - that our testing procedures cannot consider them all. We rely on our users to let us know when something unexpected happens.
</p>
<h2>Bugs</h2>
<p>
	We use the <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/or" target="_blank">Launchpad bugs</a> site to track all of our bugs. After submitting a bug, our team will evaluate it and respond; you'll be kept informed as the bug is updated.
</p>
<p>
	Before you submit a new bug, please consider:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Is the problem already reported? <i>Please don't submit duplicates</i> - you can use "Does this bug affect you?" to tell us that an existing bug affects more people.
	</li>
	<li>
		Is the problem really caused by a bug in Open Rails? <i>Please don't submit problems with your computer or Microsoft Train Simulator</i>.
	</li>
</ul>
<h2>Suggestions</h2>
<p>
	We use the <a href="https://trello.com/b/DS2h3Pxc/open-rails-roadmap" target="_blank">Trello Open Rails Roadmap board</a> to track suggestions. After submitting a suggestion, our team will evaluate it and place it in the appropriate timeline. If you want to follow its progress, you'll need a Trello account and to subscribe to the card. Please note that the timelines are fluid and should only be taken as a guide.
</p>
<p>
	Before you submit a new suggestion, please consider:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Is the suggestion already reported? <i>Please don't submit duplicates</i> - anyone can subscribe to and vote for any suggestions.
	</li>
	<li>
		Is the suggestion really relevant to Open Rails? <i>Please don't submit suggestions for new content</i> - we don't create any content.
	</li>
</ul>
