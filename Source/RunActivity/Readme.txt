Multiplayer
Choose "start as server" if you want to be the server. Client needs to know server IP and port, and can 
only start in the Explore mode or with activities without AI trains.

GRAPHICS QUALITY
Note that Open Rails isn't registered with NVidia or ATI so it will run with global settings by default.  
For best image quality customize the graphics settings in your video card control panel. If you are
setting up a program-specific custom setting, it's the RunActivity.exe program in the ORTS folder that 
you must select.
